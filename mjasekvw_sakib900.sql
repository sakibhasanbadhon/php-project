(1, '76598u875y6.jpg', 'Islam say about ramadan', 'The naming of Ramadan comes from Al Ramadan. This means fasting. Rosa is a Persian word. Fasting is the third of the five pillars of Islam. <br>\r\n According to the Shari\'ah, fasting is  eating or drinking from dawn to dusk or abstaining from any kind of food and drink. Fasting is obligatory for all of them if they have no excuse or problem. <br>Allaah has made fasting obligatory for all.\r\nNot just for us. In the time of our previous prophets, their rules were somewhat different and our rules were somewhat different.<br> Allah has instructed in this regard, O believers! Fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become righteous.\r\n (Surat al-Baqara, verse 183)\r\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: In Ramadaan the gates of heaven are opened and the gates of hell are closed. And Satan is bound.<br>\r\nDuring fasting or fasting all food and drink and everything is closed for 15 hours. During this time the liver, heart and other organs inside the abdomen get this rest. Because every organ of the body works well and after resting it works well again.<br>\r\nOn the other hand, as a result of excess food, a lot of fat accumulates inside the body. Due to which fat increases on the other hand fat accumulates in the body. All the needs of the body are met during Ramadan. Body Health Science Supriya Nutrition says:\r\nDuring fasting, body proteins, fats, sugars and other foods are easily digested.\r\n This results in the body gaining important nutrients.\r\n', '\r\nIf someone has diabetes, fasting reduces the risk of diabetes. Eating regularly means providing a stable supply of insulin to the body\'s cells. This satiety and all the cells then help to prevent insulation, it is a symptom of diabetes. However, with the occasional drop, the cells become much longer. Is faced to work more efficiently and. Its effect is to reduce the risk of high blood pressure heart attack from all other diseases as well as the risk of diabetes.<br> If you have blood pressure and heart problems, it will be effective through fasting. Studies have shown that patients with peptic ulcer benefit from fasting. The resulting heart disease is beneficial for hypertensive asthma patients. Those who have kidney problems do not want to fast but their problems will increase. But modern medical science says that fasting or fasting removes stone particles and dirt, including hair, stored in the kidneys. From this we can understand how fasting benefits our body\r\nJust as fasting has many benefits for the body, there are some rules for fasting to be makrooh. For example, intentionally inhaling water through the nose, vomiting with abusive mouth, bleeding, brushing teeth with charcoal or brushing with ointment.<br> However, we have many duties while fasting. For example, if someone jumps on us to fight, we will not fight with them. If we do these, our fast will be broken and our fast will become Makrooh.<br>\r\n\r\nThere are some rules for breaking the fast, and there are some rules for breaking the fast, such as: We cannot use drugs such as bidi-cigarettes, jorda, alcohol while fasting. <br>\r\nThe wife cannot have intercourse. Prayers should be offered five times a day from fasting. Moreover, he will not fast. We should all fast according to these. Ramadan is a month in which Allah rewards His servants the most.<br> Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\r\nThere is no one more unfortunate than him who could not forgive the sins of his life in the month of Ramadan. Because the month of Ramadan is the month of the revelation of the Qur\'an. The Qur\'an has been revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).<br> So if we can read this Qur\'an every day in the month of Ramadan, then Allah will give us more rewards. In the month of Ramadan, Allah Ta\'ala opens His Paradise for the fasting people and presents for them a very precious gift for fasting. For fasting people, fasting increases peace of mind.<br>\r\nThe rule in the time of our previous prophets was that if a person could not fast or did not want to fast, he would feed it to the poor or the beggar with satisfaction. But since the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) no one can break the fast in Ramadan even if he wants to. Only those who have special excuses, such as if they are ill, if they are menstruating, if they are insane, etc., are allowed to leave.\r\n', 'islam', 'About Ramajan', 235),
(2, '65675564587.jpg', 'Corona virus  covid19', 'The deadly epidemic of coronavirus has wreaked havoc around the world. Coronavirus in all countries of the world no matter what you look at. It is a virus that resides in the human body and can infect a person from illness to death. I will discuss whether there is a deadly bacterium like coronavirus and what Islam advises on its cure and prevention. Narrated from Hazrat Ayesha Siddiqa (RA), she said that I asked Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) what. Then he told me it was a punishment. God punishes whomever He wills. When it is gracious to the believers. At this time, if a person is afflicted with an epidemic and patiently waits for the reward of Allah in his house, he voluntarily believes that nothing will happen except what Allah has ordained for him. This person will be entitled to the equivalent of the martyr\'s thawab. <br>(Sahih Al-Bukhari, Hadith No. 3484, Nasai, As Sunanul Kubra, Hadith No. 6527, Musnad Ahmad Hadith No. 38139)\r\nThe rules of Islam can protect against the effects of coronavirus. Muslims go to the mosque five times a day and perform prayers and perform ablution five times in these five times. To perform ablution one has to wash hands, feet, nose, neck, fingers, and face. Meanwhile, the doctor said that if you want to be protected from coronavirus, you have to wash your hands most of the time and stay clean. It is possible to have that clean cleansing through ablution. Then it remains to be understood how much Islam is able to save people even in epidemics.<br>\r\nIslam says that after sneezing and coughing, you should put your hands or clothes in your mouth. As if there is a disease in one\'s own body, it does not enter the body of another through the air. Islam says that cleanliness is a part of faith. Every prayer should be performed by wearing beautiful clothes. Islam says that in the event of an epidemic, a person should not leave his own place and go elsewhere. <br>Because if he goes to another city with the disease from that place, then most of the people can get infected with the disease through him. That is why it has been said that you will not go from one place to another during an epidemic. Be patient at home and seek the pleasure of Allah. Then God will protect you.\r\n', 'The plague once spread in the form of an epidemic during the reign of the Caliph Hazrat Omar (may Allah be pleased with him). The site was a jihadist stronghold in Palestine. Ubaidah ibn Jarrah was in charge there and appointed Ibn Jabal as the army chief before his death. He too died of an epidemic at the age of 48. At this time, when Hazrat Omar Rajela (R) approached Al-Quddus, the chief of the region, to see for himself the situation on the battlefield, he was informed that there was an epidemic in the region. He instructed the troops with him to stay on horseback at night. As he was returning in the morning, someone asked him if he was running away. Hazrat Omar (RA) said: I am going from one destination to another. The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If you hear that there is an epidemic in any area. But you will not enter it. And if you hear that there is a plague there, you will not get out of it. Caliph Omar Rajela (R) has stayed at home following another hadith.<br>\r\nThe people of Israel once had a plague. Allah\'s command was that the fear of death should not flee from one place to another. But they fled their country and went elsewhere. They fled between the two mountains. Allaah killed them all together.<br>\r\nAllaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Do you not know that those people left their homes for fear of death? Then Allaah told them to die. Then Allah revived them. Surely Allah is gracious to mankind. But most people do not express gratitude.<br>\r\nBalaam Ibn Baul wanted to recite bad prayers against Prophet Moses. But it is a curse for one\'s own community. He then advised his people to send beautiful women to the markets of Israel to sell their wares. Beautiful girls take various products to the children of Israel. When the children of Israel committed adultery with these women, the plague came as the wrath of God. 70,000 Jews died in it. Interpretation of Surah Araf verse 176.\r\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that whatever a person chooses for himself. If others do not like it. Then he can never be a Muslim believer. Sahih Bukhari. Islam teaches to be humane all the time. Islam teaches to be a person of sensitive empathy.<br> So at the time of coronation, follow the rules of Islamic law, stay healthy yourself and help others to stay healthy. Amen. \r\n', 'islam', 'Instructions', 236),
(3, 'Capture677557075t75.jpg', 'About corruption say Islam', 'Islam is the only religion chosen by Allah. He who follows Islam will be a perfect Muslim and a perfect Muslim will one day be free from corruption.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: You can do business if you want, you can get a job, but do not be corrupt. Yet people are equally guilty of corruption as they are giving and taking bribes. Here they are doing corruption. They are both hellish hells. <br>The prayers and fasting of those who commit corruption and remain in corruption will not be accepted. Even if he circumambulates Makkah, his sins will not be forgiven. If one is in an impure state or does not perform the obligatory bath, his prayers will not be accepted. In the same way, if a person spends haraam wealth in the way of Allah, Allah will not accept his worship for the sake of reward.\r\nHazrat Omar Farooq (may Allah be pleased with him) never did haraam things and did not eat haraam food. <br>They lived a simple life. They are not satisfied with what they have got. Islam has always believed in ethics and prosperity. So corruption is forbidden in Islam because there are many kinds of sins associated with it. Enough to take a man to hell. Prohibition of unjustly occupying land It is also prohibited to take away all the property of the people by filing a case with the ruling class for embezzlement. Allaah further says that it is not the honor of the Prophet to conceal anything. Prophets are of good character. They did not hide anything and always spoke the truth. Whoever conceals something will appear before Allah on the Day of Resurrection with that secret thing.<br>\r\nAt present corruption has become a social disorder. Corruption is entering our society step by step in every field. But there is no place for corruption in Islamic law. The Holy Qur\'an speaks of the terrible consequences of corruption in the hadith and in many places. Corruption is the misappropriation or misappropriation of property. Such as theft, robbery, embezzlement, breach of trust, bribery, interest, gambling, rape, all kinds of wrongdoings are included in corruption. If we do any of these, we will corrupt it.\r\n', 'The corrupt will be severely punished in the Hereafter. Even on the Day of Resurrection he will bring his embezzled wealth on his back. There is a humiliating punishment in this world and in the hereafter for corruption.<br>\r\nIf a person has a rich man in him, then he becomes corrupt. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: I fear most that the blessings of this world will be opened for you. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Abundance is the wealth of the world, the blessing of the world is abundance.<br>\r\nA corrupt man can never be a good man. A person who is not ashamed can engage in any corrupt activity. So it is important to be ashamed of each person. A man cannot do bad things if he is ashamed. Spend in the way of Allah and do not throw yourselves into destruction with your own hands. And whatever you do, surely Allah loves the doers of good.<br>\r\nAll we can do to get rid of corruption is to create fear of God in the heart, to be content with little, to give thanks to God, to refrain from greed, to give moral education, not to oppress anyone, to teach in religious teachings, accountability in the hereafter. Awakening of fear in the heart, creating social awareness against corruption, giving more and more charity, refraining from kufr activities. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): â€œVerily, the wealth and children of those who disbelieve will not benefit Allaah in the least. And they are the dwellers of the Fire. If he commits extra corruption, he will not be human gradually. He turned into an animal. When man becomes an animal, he has no fear of God. He is not allowed to do anything like stealing, robbing, killing, committing adultery.<br>\r\nThe characteristic of an ideal person is to instruct good deeds and forbid bad deeds, to make the good things in life lawful and to forbid those which are harmful to life. Encourage people to do good deeds and forbid evil deeds and remain steadfast in faith in Allah.<br>\r\nWe have to follow the path of Allah. There is no benefit in giving alms to show people. Those who do not believe in Allah and the Hereafter, their condition will be very bad. For example, a little soil on the rock and seeds and buckets of rain on it came and washed the rock and made it clean. In such a situation it is not possible to get the crop from the seed. <br>\r\nIn the same way, no reward can be expected from the  shown to the people. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): It is better for you to give alms openly. And if you do it secretly and give alms to the needy, then it is better for you. He will forgive some of your sins. And Allh is All-Aware of what you do.<br>\r\nAnd fear the Day when you shall be nigh to Allah. Then each person will be fully informed of the consequences of his actions. And no injustice will be done to them.\r\n', 'islam', 'Instructions', 223),
(4, '5cd70854210000580078eb54.jpg', 'illligel love in islam', 'The word love is not forbidden in Islam. <br>But illicit love is forbidden in Islam. The only difference is legal love and illegal love. husband and wife love is holy love. But it is haraam to have a physical or mental relationship with a girl before marriage\r\nAdultery is forbidden in Islam. Similarly, extramarital affairs are forbidden in Islam. No young man or woman is allowed to have illicit intercourse in Islam. From the life of Prophet Yusuf (peace be upon him), it is known that it is haraam to make love and adultery before marriage. Many beautiful women in Egypt were attracted to the beauty of the Prophet Joseph (peace be upon him) when they saw him, and the most beautiful woman in Egypt, Zulekha, was attracted to her beauty. Attempts to have illicit relations with Hazrat Yusuf Alai Salam failed due to the power of Zulekha. Allah the Almighty helped Hazrat Yusuf (as). We can learn from the biographies of the prophets that illicit love or illicit intercourse between a young boy and a young girl does not support Islam and other religions. And this sin is called the sin of Islamic poets.\r\nWe know that the punishment for Kabira\'s sin is terrible. Poets are not forgiven until they ask God for forgiveness. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: Use life before death comes. Use youth before old age. So whenever you get an opportunity, you have to use the opportunity for good without abusing it. The characteristic of God\'s beloved people is that they do not look down on any girl. And the characteristic of true believers is that they do not look down on any girl. They will not disturb any girl on the way. Do not abuse or annoy any girl.<br>\r\nIf it takes place among them, they will regret and repent, but their marriage is valid, but it is not valid to marry them unless they do so. If a man wants to marry an adulterous girl, he must wait until the menstrual cycle. That it is necessary to make sure that she is not pregnant before entering into a marriage contract with her.

The holiest and best place on earth. <br>Muslims go to the mosque to worship and obey Allah. Muslims pray in the mosque every day and attend the mosque five times a day for the purpose of worshiping Allah. The relationship of Muslims with other religions is not the same as the relationship of Muslims in mosques. The mosque is the cultural center of Islam. Muslims have a very close relationship with mosques.<br>They pray in the mosque five times a day and keep track of each other. Islam gives religious freedom to every human being. So that the followers of other religions can practice their religion freely.\r\nThe Nawabi Mosque is the longest and largest mosque in the world. The length of this mosque is about 1 km. There is a no bigger mosque in the world. Every year people from different countries come to perform Hajj and perform prayers in the mosque.<br>\r\n The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that if he intentionally misses prayers in congregation in the mosque, then his loneliness prayers will not be accepted. It is most important to perform the prayers in Jamaat for the obligatory prayers. Sunnat prayers can be performed at home or without the congregation in the mosque. Hadrat Ibn \'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said that if a person does not pray in congregation in the mosque after hearing the call to prayer, then his prayers will not be performed. In this case, Allah Ta\'ala has given some concessions.\r\n He instructed them to go to the mosque and pray in the congregation if there is no danger or illness. In other words, it is not obligatory to go to the mosque only in case of danger. Moreover, if you are traveling, you are allowed to recite half of the obligatory prayers. If there is no mosque in the vicinity, then if three or more people are present there, the time prayers can be performed in congregation. \r\n', 'There is no excuse for prayers. Because on the Day of Judgment, Allah will take account of the prayers first. After hearing the call of Hazrat Abdullah, go to the mosque for prayers. <br>Because the five unspoken prayers bring people to the path of guidance. Those who are ill still want to go to the mosque, but they can pray while sitting or in a chair.<br> If you pray in the mosque without hope, you will deny the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and will be deprived of space. And if he is deprived of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or embraces himself, he will become a kaafir. If you pray in congregation in the mosque, you will get 27 times more thawab.\r\nThere is only one Imam in every mosque and that Imam leads all the prayers. Through prayer, Muslims seek help from Allah Tala. And Allah Tara says in the Qur\'an, \"You have helped me through prayer. Ask for help.\" There are some rules for praying in the mosque. For example, one has to enter the mosque with the right foot and exit with the left foot. After entering the mosque, one has to perform two racks of prayer in order to fulfill the rights of the mosque.<br> Then everyone will pray together with the Imam at the appointed time.\r\nSome other rights of the mosque have to be fulfilled such as: If there is dirt in the mosque, it should be cleaned, no loud words should be spoken in the mosque, no abuse should be done in the mosque, no one should be abused, no one should be beaten, no worldly message should be said Etc.\r\n', 'islam', 'Instructions', 271),

Some people believe that human rights are the most important right so animal rights are not a matter of urgency. They do not please the animal so they use it cruelly.\r\nMany of us call cats bad. We don\'t like cats, we hate them. But Abu Hurairah, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), used to like cats. Narrated Abu Huraira: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: A man was walking on the road and he was thirsty. <br>Then he looked around and saw a well. The man went down to the well and drank some water and thanked Allah. Coming out of the well, he saw a dog sticking out its tongue and licking the mud. The man thought to himself that the dog was in the same condition as I was due to thirst. He softened his mind, put on his socks, fetched water from the well, and fed the dog. For this reason, Allah rewarded him and forgave him.<br>\r\nHazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: Different species of insects live in the hole, so do not urinate there, it will ruin their habitat and they will suffer. God has created many species of animals.<br> Basically created all animals or everything human needs. Without biodiversity, the balance of the environment would never have been right.<br> The whole world would become uninhabitable. We get many benefits from living, including food, from animals. Even animals that are harmful to humans cannot be exterminated.

Narrated from Hazrat Abdul Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that fighting game among animals is forbidden.

(7, 'khoma.jpg', 'What Islam says about forgiveness', 'Forgiveness is a great virtue. GOD loves to forgive, and He loves to forgiver. People are not above mistakes. A man hopes for forgiveness when he makes a mistake. There are many people in our society who make mistakes every day. GOD loves the doers of good.<br>\r\nIslam speaks of two kinds of forgiveness: the forgiveness of God and the forgiveness of man. If we disobey God\'s commandments and disobey Him, God will forgive us. Then if he seeks forgiveness from Allah from his heart, Allah will forgive him. And this is the forgiveness of Allah. And people are forgiven: fighting with someone, quarreling, hurting someone,\r\nHe apologizes to someone for hurting him when he treats someone badly, and if he forgives, it is human forgiveness. As human beings, we need the forgiveness of both. Just as there are some mistakes in our relationship with God, we also make many mistakes in our relationship as human beings. There are many names of Allah in the Qur\'an, these are called Asmaul Husna.\r\nIt means beautiful names. These names of Allah reveal the merits and characteristics. Different names have meanings involved, such as Allah Al Ghafoor means Allah is Forgiving. Some other names have come from the source of this name in the Qur\'an.\r\nWe all ask God for forgiveness and if people make mistakes we need to forgive them. So I developed the habit of forgiving people.<br>\r\nIt is said in the Qur\'an, \"Run to the forgiveness of your Lord.\" The boundaries of which are endlessly for honest people, believers, and pious people. Those who spend their lives in prosperity and deprivation. Allah loves those who are patient in their anger and love to forgive others. Indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.\r\n', 'Allah is Forgiving, so if someone treats you badly, you will forgive him. <br> Arrogance, anger, and violence burn people\'s minds. But if you forgive, everything is fine and God is pleased.<br>\r\nWe ask God for forgiveness, but we do not forgive people. If you want to ask forgiveness from Allah, you have to forgive people first.<br> Only then can the grace of Allah be obtained and forgiveness is obtained from Allah.\r\n\r\nForgiveness and mercy to man is God\'s forgiveness. In this connection Allaah says, ‘And if you forgive them; Forgive and forgive their faults, but know that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.  (Surah Tagabun: verse 14)\r\n\r\nThe Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) loved to forgive.<br> He forgave against any wrongdoing. Before going to sleep at night, you have to get rid of all anger and hatred from your mind and sleep peacefully. Allah likes this.\r\nSo forgive to get forgiven. Also, forgive the person who stole your favorite thing. If you don\'t forgive, you won\'t get the thing back. But if you forgive, you will gain something greater than that, and Allah will be pleased with you.<br>\r\nIn this world, we can get great forgiveness through small forgiveness. Maybe because of this forgiveness, Allah will forgive us from hell.<br>\r\nOne person would lend to people or sell the rest of the goods. The man told his employee to forgive him if he was Helpless. Maybe Allah will forgive us. Then after a while, he met Allah (died) and Allah forgave him.\r\nSahih Muslim, Hadith 1562, Sahih Bukhari, Hadith 3480\r\nSo forgiveness is the best and most effective way to get forgiveness. If I forgive people, then hopefully Allah will forgive me in return.\r\nForgiveness in return for forgiveness. As Allah says in Surah Ar-Rahman, Ehsan to Ehsan. God forgives people with small excuses and He seeks excuses to forgive. Allah Tayala loves us very much. He doesn’t want to give us hell in any way.

God created the human and jinn nations only to worship Him. All that God has created on the earth is good for mankind. He created everything for the good of mankind. He did not create anything in vain. <br>Similarly, no one has created man in vain. God consulted with the angels before creating the Prophet Adam (peace be upon him). <br>He created him and then gave him the Alem, then Hawa Alai Sallam was created. Allah Almighty arranged for both of them to stay in Paradise. But at one time Allah was displeased with them and became dissatisfied with them. Once upon a time, they were sent to earth. But later Allah forgave them and said that those who are on the path of truth, will walk on the path of truth, will do good deeds will be free from worries The more time they spend in their lives, the more time they will be destined for Paradise and Hell.\r\nGod has many motives behind human creation. God created man to worship Him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): I have created the jinn and mankind for My worship. God created man as a caliph. So that people can implement the law of God on earth. Allah says I want to make a representative on earth. When Allaah told the angels about the creation of man, the angels said, \"Will you create someone who will cause chaos and bloodshed in the world?\" That is to say, the angels here made people think that they would only cause bloodshed in the world and make it worse. But Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): You do not know what I know.\r\nIf they ask God for forgiveness for their wrongdoing, God will forgive them. <br>Human creation is one of God\'s creations. Then Allaah sent Gabriel to the earth to bring soil. God created the Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) and created his wife Eve from Adam. Allah Ta\'ala created all human beings from Adam and Eve.\r\n', ' In this regard, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):Water is the main element in the creation of everything on earth. Water exists in all living things on earth, which is why water is called life. <br>I can\'t imagine a moment without water. (Surah: Ambiya verse: 30)\r\nThe main constituents of the earth\'s living cells are water. <br>Similarly, water is the main component of soil productivity.<br> Allah Almighty created a human being from the earth and sent it to the earth and since then it has spread all over the world. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): I created you from a male and a female. And We have divided you into different parts and tribes. So that you can get to know each other.<br>\r\nGod created us with a lot of love. He could feed, drink, and reproduce human beings like other living creatures. But he did not do that. He gave man dignity above all life. But most people who disbelieve in God forget Him. He forgets the purpose and purpose of his creation. they seem those are the ways of the Creator to enjoy everything in the human world. In fact, these people are like the life of an animal. Rather much worse than them.<br>\r\nIn other verses, Allah Ta\'ala says, \"I created man from rotten mud.\" (Surah: Hijr verse: 26). In another verse, Allah the Almighty says, \"We created the nation from dry clay like terracotta.\" (Surah Ar-Rahman verse: 14). The Almighty created Hawa (peace be upon him) from the ribs of Adam (peace be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that the female race was created by the curved bones of the ribs. And the upper heart is the most curved of the ribs. And if you ever go straight for it, it will break. And if you give up, it will last forever. So talk to women in a good manner. (Bukhari Hadith: 3045)\r\nAllah the Almighty has said that He created the heavens, the earth, the world, life, death, happiness, peace, enjoyment, luxury to test man. Who obeys God and who does not? Reward him who does. And whoever disobeys will be punished. He created life and death. May Allah test your locks. Which of you is the best in terms of deeds? He is the Mighty, the Forgiving. (Surah: Al-Mulk verse: 2).\r\nGod created us. He loves us so much. But even then we don’t want Allah obedience. I don\'t want to follow his words. I do not want to live according to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). But those who disobey Allah, Allah will punish them severely.

The proof of this is that Hadrat Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to free himself and he used to clean himself with water. Because the only way to get rid of impurities is to use water. You use water to clean some dirt from your hands and feet. Just like after bathing you need to be well cleaned. Stones can be used or dry loose can be used. Prohibited to remove impurity with dry dung.<br>\r\nHowever, our personal parts must be washed after using the toilet paper in our toilet. Toilet paper alone is not acceptable for our prayers to be valid. Unless nearby water is available a few miles away. Every Muslim should wash himself with water before performing ablutions no matter how much he uses his own toilet roll.<br>\r\nThere is a lot of discomforts when using tissues without water in the toilet. If no one has tried it yet, you should. I\'m sure you\'ve never felt healthier. However, many people use toilet paper. I\'m not saying it\'s bad. But just tell me why you are repeatedly wiping the dishes on your plate and even a spoon with a kitchen towel. We are talking about the human body. For this you need to take a bath once every 3 days. Because the Islamic state uses water. Use soil when water is scarce.\r\n', ' You do not see that the Creator of God\'s command is perfect for His creation. Of course, many people use it as a supplement to wash with water. To get rid of any excess, wipe with a TP, then wash off with water to get rid of the rest.<br> Plus TP can also be used to wipe the toilet seat later. Cleanliness is preached in life and prayer is obligatory.<br>\r\nIslam is not limited to prayers and fasting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A Muslim is a person from whose hands and mouth all people are safe. <br>v Purity is a part of faith. It is the word of Hadith.\r\nWe can use tissues in the bathroom only when there is no water supply. Because it is not desirable for Muslims to use only toilet paper even if they have water after finishing the bathroom. If there is no water around, toilet paper can be used. However, there are many downsides to toilet paper that can be a health risk. Toilet paper contains many pathogens and the skin can be cut due to the use of uneven toilet paper.

In reply, Allah says that at the time of death, the angels will say, \"We are your companions in this world and in the Hereafter.\" So do not be afraid to die.<br> Don\'t worry. There you will find what you want and what you want there. Now the question is, without destroying the world and without creating a new kind of earth, Allah could have given the peace of heaven here. And He could punish the disbelievers and the polytheists in this world. But without that, we need to destroy everything and create a new world. The answer to this question is the afterlife. See the real essence of science. The afterlife to give us what we want. What we want is for God to give us in the Hereafter. The answer is that we want good deeds and bad deeds on earth. The good fruit of good deeds and the bad fruit of evil deeds. This is the deepest demand of every human being in the world. Where God has created, He has fulfilled the demands. And Allah has clearly stated in Surah Ar-Rahman that all kinds of creatures, including the creatures, are constantly asking Allah for something or other.<br>\r\nThe heavens and the earth and all that is in them all seek Allah to meet their own needs. In every moment of work, he is giving what he needs. As I have seen the words of God in this world. We will see the same in the hereafter as well as in the hereafter.<br> The word of God is synonymous with truth. Such as the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki or the one that burned half a million people in a matter of seconds. More than half a million people were injured. At the same time, the cultivable land there became copper. If this person is to be punished, he will have to die 5 million times. Either there should be no punishment or proper justice. The person who met his newly married wife to work for the sake of Allah became a martyr in this way. What reward can be given to him if he is to be given a fair reward like his.<br>\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to create such a system world to meet the needs of the minds of every human being in the world. In the world of that system, good deeds will make him feel good. Man can be rewarded according to his debt and according to the reward he can be given while enjoying it. Who have killed 50 lakh or more people. Even if they are killed more than once, it is as if they are resurrected. For this reason, only in this demand of the human mind, good deeds get good results and bad deeds get bad results. That system is in this world and in the Hereafter, the kind of punishment and the kind of system that life needs. What will happen in the Hereafter will be to fulfill the demands of the human mind. Their advantage was understood in the work of how scientific and rational it is.<br>\r\nThe afterlife is a place where every person on earth has to give an account of his good and bad. If someone does something bad, he has to give an account of that work. Whoever does a good deed will be rewarded. Those who disobey Allah in this world, perform the prayers, say bad things, hurt people, fight, kill people, Allah will punish them in the Hereafter and not in this world. Surely Allah is the just judge.\r\n', 'The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was always worried about the Hereafter.<br> He warned everyone about the torment and horror of the Hereafter. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Take your Paradise, that is, protect yourself from the two of you. I cannot remove the punishment of Allaah from you. I mean, descendants, I will not be able to remove God\'s punishment from you. O Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib, I cannot remove the wrath of Allah from you. O daughter of Fatima, you can get the goods from me, but I cannot save you from the punishment of Allah.

If you stay in the tunnel.<br>\r\nOn the Day of Resurrection, Allah will first take account of the prayers. Allah has spoken of the eighty-eight prayers in the Qur\'an for His beloved servants. He said sinners would be questioned and told why they were going to hell. We did not pray, we did not starve the poor, we did not look for others, which is why we are going to hell today. Verses 40 to 45 of Surah Muddaththir say that when a servant is left in the grave, his companions hear the sound of their shoes as they leave. At that time two angels came to them and asked him what he thought of this great man. He says: I bear witness that he is the servant of Allah and His Messenger. <br>\r\nThen he was told to look at your abode in Hell, instead I gave you abode in Paradise.

A believer can never do bad deeds, can never steal, can never commit adultery, can never drink alcohol, can never loot.<br>\r\nIslam has declared alcohol to be forbidden forever. Therefore, there is no place for intoxicants in Islam.<br>\r\nHazrat Abu Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that he said: My dear friend, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave me last advice. You shall not set up partners with God. Even if you are cut to pieces or you are burned to death. <br>You will not give up any obligatory prayers on purpose. Because I will be free from the responsibility of the person who intentionally skips the prayers and you will not drink alcohol.<br>\r\nAlcohol is forbidden in Islam. However, in the pre-Islamic era we had a wide circulation. If there was no alcohol, they would not have any party. In the early days of Islam, noticing the addiction of people to alcohol, Allah gradually adopted the method of forbidding alcohol. Because it is possible to commit any sin if you are addicted to drugs. Corruption is possible, adultery is possible, injustice is possible.<br>\r\nIt is narrated on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed 10 people. 1 grape juice, 2 winemakers, 3 winemakers, 4 to whom it is carried, 5 wine tellers, 8 sellers, 8 wine drinkers, 8 wine furniture buyers, 9 winemakers Which is purchased for the purpose, and 10 drinkers.<br>\r\n According to Imam Abu Hanifa Rahmatullah and Imam Malik Rahmatullah, eighty lashes of free drinking punishment. In the time of the Companions, if a slave girl committed this crime, she would be flogged 40 times. Even then he would have been killed if the alcoholic had not changed. Because alcohol has many harmful aspects. Such as loss of appetite, loss of digestion, ulcers, acidity, constipation, damage to the airways, constriction of the eyeballs, loss of vision, whooping cough, shortness of breath, etc. There are many other problems such as changes in blood cell count, decreased immunity, anemia, jaundice, hepatitis, liver, cirrhosis, decreased kidney function, frequent infections, eventually kidney failure, loss of thinking, intoxication. ', 'Reading, suicidal tendencies, memory loss, restlessness, depression, etc. are many more physical and mental problems.<br>\r\nNo alcoholic remembers anything while drinking. At the time of drinking, his faith became in his heart and a shadow hung over his head. Then when he is free from alcohol, his faith returns. The same situation happens with theft.<br>\r\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn \'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said in his speech while standing on the pulpit of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that the prohibition of alcohol has been revealed in five cases. Grapes, barley, dates, honey, wheat. And what makes the intellect and conscience disappear.<br>\r\nBy drinking alcohol the alcoholic can do all the work. Alcohol causes intoxication in people. The intellect-conscience loses everything. Behaves like crazy or behaves abnormally. Alcohol damages health and causes huge financial losses. Since alcohol causes people to commit many social crimes, alcohol is said to be the key to all evil.<br>\r\nIt is narrated on the authority of Ibn \'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Every intoxicant is included and every object is forbidden. Whoever drinks alcohol in this world and then dies with the habit of drinking alcohol without repenting to Allah will not be able to drink alcohol in Paradise in the Hereafter.<br>\r\nWhen people drink alcohol, they do not hesitate to do any heinous act. He doesn\'t even know what he\'s doing when he\'s drunk. To him, all work will seem to be reversed. Then he can do any bad deed or evil deed. That is why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that wine is the key to all evil. And it is not lawful for a drunkard to worship. Once he drinks alcohol, his prayers will not be accepted for 40 days. It is obligatory for fiqh scholars to punish the drinker and the maker. On the other hand, it is haraam to drink and prepare alcohol. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed both him and the maker.\r\n We can take some steps to eliminate addiction. These include inculcating Islamic values among all, ending unemployment, treating drug addicts, stopping the production and trade of drugs, converting young people to Islam and awakening their values, educating everyone about the evils of drugs, Keep an eye on Intoxication is a terrible thing in this world and in the Hereafter, so staying away from it is a matter of faith.\r\n', 'islam', 'Instructions', 267);

There is another narration that I will throw him into the fire of hell.\r\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to perform ablution when one is angry. Because the human body gets heated during anger. The veins and sub-veins become swollen, the manifestation of heated fire. Since fire is created by water, he instructed to perform ablution with water during anger. So that through water Allah cools his body and soothes anger. When people are angry, they lose their sense of humor. Good and bad do not get a chance to be considered with an unjust conscience. As a result, any kind of wrongdoing can be committed by him.\r\n', 'Pride is a deadly sin. Allah will cast the arrogant into Hell. They will be the dwellers of Hell. The evils and consequences of arrogance are very terrible. Allah has created man with great care. God has given us innumerable blessings to make people comfortable. So that we can better obey and worship Allah. But people forget the gift of God and show arrogance and think of themselves as great.<br> As a result, Allah became dissatisfied with him. Allah does not like this arrogance at all.\r\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Anger comes from Shaytaan and Shaytaan has been created a stream of fire. And the fire can be extinguished by water, so whoever is angry with you, let him take ablution with water. <br> The flames ignite people so the work of a true Muslim is sometimes angry to perform ablution to prevent this anger. Pride cannot be the nature of believers. People are subjugated and lose the right knowledge and do many wrongs. Then he has no knowledge of right and wrong in his head.<br> Because unjust destruction is the nature of these devils. That is why it is said that anger comes from Satan.<br>\r\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that three deeds destroy people. That is: (1) do ethics according to the will of the mind. Because doing bad things destroys people. (2) In spite of having wealth, giving food and clothing to the family, not giving alms, not giving zakat. The tendency to save money destroys people. (3) Feeling good about yourself.<br> That is to be happy with one\'s own work and to suffer in self-satisfaction. This creates arrogance and makes one feel too big and others too small. Which could destroy him.<br>\r\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked his Companions one day, \"Which of you do you think is the strongest?\" In answer to the question, the Companions said that a person can beat another in wrestling. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that it is not the real hero who loses in wrestling but the real hero who is able to control himself in anger. <br>(Bukhari 574)\r\nBut Islam does not encourage a person without anger. Because in some cases there is talk of expressing anger and resentment. The cases in which Islam has allowed anger must be in the field of propaganda of the day. You can get angry when preaching religion but not in an unjust way. Scholars say that when there is anger, you will think how much bigger my Creator is than me. What will happen to me if he is angry with me. Muttakin is a person who is patient and forgiving. God bless these people. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Run to your Lord for forgiveness and to Paradise. Whose breath is equal to the heavens and the earth. May the Almighty grant us the strength to endure anger and show us the way to escape from arrogance. Amen.\r\n', 'islam', 'Instructions', 254),

This Qur\'an was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) for 23 long years through the angel Gabriel for the salvation of mankind in this world and in the hereafter. Of all the heavenly books, the Qur\'an is the last and greatest book. So that there is no doubt. According to the Qur\'an, Islam is a complete way of life.<br> God sent man to earth to establish his caliphate. He has set clear worldly and otherworldly principles for the perfect peace of human life. After the revelation of the Qur\'an, there is no other book in heaven. Al-Qur\'an is full of the necessary guidance and basic information of science to the world.<br>\r\nEach librarian usually writes at the beginning of their book that if there is any mistake in this preparation, they should inform the author. Make no mistake about editing a book later. But the Qur\'an is a book without a doubt. Allah says it is the only book so there is no doubt. Allah has given an open challenge to the whole mankind and the jinn to find out the mistake in the Qur\'an. No one has ever been able to discover a book like the Qur\'an. <br> The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):  (Surah Bani Isra\'il verse 88)\r\nThere are 114 surahs of Al-Quran including Makki sura, 92. many Madani Surahs were revealed before the migration of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) And what was revealed after the migration is called Madani Surah. There are 540 ruku\'s in the Quran.<br>\r\nIn the Qur\'an, the Makki Surahs usually discuss the basics of Tawheed, the Message, the Hereafter, the Resurrection, Heaven, and the Imams of Hell. And in the Madani Surahs, Islamic law, buying, and selling, prayers, fasting, Hajj, zakat, politics, economy, nationality, international, social politics, etc. have been described in detail.\r\n', 'In the month of Ramadan, the entire Qur\'an was revealed on the night of Laylat al-Qadr, near Baitul Izzat, the nearest place from Laohe Mahfuz on the throne of God. In this context, Allah the Almighty has said in the Qur\'an: I am the one who sent down the Qur\'an on my blessed night. (Surah Ad-Dukhan verses 2 to 3)\r\nThe Qur\'an was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) through revelation. The prophrt  revelation means to convey something secretly.<br> Allaah the Almighty said to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): I have sent down upon you the Qur\'aan in parts or in pieces. So that you can spread the verses of this Qur\'an among all and cover it all and recite it.<br>\r\nAl-Qur\'an\'s role in solving life\'s problems is immense. For example, the role of the Qur\'an in personal life, family life, social life, state life, international life is immense. In private life man is much more guilty of stealing his normal character robbery, drinking, lying, and so on. The Qur\'an gives advice for deliverance from all sins and from all sins. People fall into various problems in social life, people in family life. Such as parents, siblings, husband and wife, relatives, parents, how to treat them. How to realize their rights. Everything about how to respect the elders is very well and clearly mentioned in the Qur\'an. The role of Al-Quran in medical field is very effective.<br> People are treated by various verses of Al-Quran. Al-Qur\'an provides solutions to many complex and various problems. Because Allah has said that the Qur\'an is a sign for the wise.<br>\r\nThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Book was revealed to Ibraaheem on the first night of Ramadaan. Then on the night of the 6th of Ramadan, the Torah was revealed to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). <br> Then on the 12th day of the month of Ramadan, the Book of Psalms was revealed to the Prophet David. On the 13th of this month, the Gospel was revealed to the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him). The Qur\'an was revealed on the night of Qadr at the end of the month with the blessings of Ramadan. Allaah has clearly mentioned in the Qur\'aan above the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): (Surah Bani Isra\'il verse 82)\r\nAl-Qur\'an is a complete aparna complete epic about the overall life of man. Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a prophet sent by Allah. In the same way, the Qur\'an revealed to him is the certificate of emancipation of all human beings.<br>\r\nPeople have to face innumerable problems while living in the society. Such as quarrels, injustices, tortures are involved in all kinds of anti-social activities. The Qur\'an strictly forbids the Majid and on the other hand the Qur\'an urges to build a society for a just society. In the same way, happiness and peace in the life of the state depends on whether the government is able to meet all the needs of the citizens on the basis of mutual consent. The Qur\'an confirms how he should exercise power. May Allah grant us the grace to live according to the Qur\'an, Amin\r\n', 'islam', 'Quran', 282),
(14, 'intarest_in_islam.jpg', 'Islam say about intarest', 'The interest system, known as the poison of the economy, plays an active role in making the rich richer and the poor poorer. <br> Therefore, in the eyes of Islam, there is nothing more heinous than an interest. This haram interest in Islam is one of the heinous acts. In four verses of Surah Al-Baqarah and three verses of Surah Al-Imran, Allah discusses the rules of usury and exposes its illegality. Those who take interest will be punished in this world as well as in the Hereafter. Hazrat Ata Radiyallahu Ta\'ala Anhu said that the people of the Shakif tribe of the Jahiliyyah era traded interest with Ganu Nazir on a large scale when it was time for the council. Then the poor people could not pay the interest and extended the time. At that time the people of Banu Nazir also increased their interest. As a result of increasing the time several times, the people of Nazir occupied the lands of all the people of the Chakif tribe. Their movable and immovable property would become the owner of these things overnight. Thus he received compound interest from the poor. Forbidding them this tyranny, Allah says in the Qur\'an: Those who eat usury will stand. The way he stands is the person whom the devil enchants. The two reasons for their punishment are that they have eaten haraam through usury, they have considered usury as halal like buying and selling usury. <br> Those who take usury, even after receiving a reminder from Allah, will have a severe punishment. And those who do not take interest after the prohibition of Allah, Allah can forgive them.\r\nInterest is a heinous crime that destroys the relationship between siblings. <br> Destroys relationships between relatives. <br> Those who take interest become once wild animals. Saving the wealth of others, sucking the blood of the people, and taking possession of the wealth of others becomes the main goal of their life. <br>\r\nThe poor of the society becomes poorer and reach the level of beggars. Then the rich become the object of neglect, while they neglect hatred when they become impatient, they also begin to harbor hatred towards the rich. Then they hate the rich. <br> Interest creates various kinds of chaos in society and the state. For example, if the lender fails to pay the interest payable, punitive measures are taken against the borrowers, which leads to chaos in society. Many transgress and Allah has made it clear in the Qur\'an that I do not like transgressors, so do not transgress.\r\n', 'The infidels of Arabia used to do usury and say it was just a simple business like buying and selling. But Allaah has made buying and selling lawful and has given honor and has forbidden usury.<br> Because interest is a very serious social disorder. Society gradually drifts towards destruction and destroys the people of the society. Business, on the other hand, is the business of social peace. It is Sunnah to do business so there are many differences between usury and business. Interest and business are not the same things. And for those who think these two things are one, there is a punishment.<br>\r\n\r\nYou can\'t eat interest, you can\'t eat bank interest and you can\'t eat compound interest at all. This is an extremely heinous act. You can\'t eat interest, you have to trade against interest. God has made business lawful and usury unlawful. You have to do business with the profit and loss of the business.<br> Only then will Allah grant mercy in business. Because money never comes from money, money comes from hard work.<br>\r\nAllah destroys the blessings of the usurer in the world. As narrated from Ibn Mas\'ud, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Although more is seen, it is towards its final outcome. Ibn \'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said that usury destroys the blessings of the Hereafter and pushes towards sin. As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Allaah does not accept usury, Hajj, struggle for the cause of Allaah, etc. (Qurtubi)\r\n The sin of usury is so deadly that it is one of the seven greatest sins. One dirham of interest is more deadly to Allah than 36 jinns. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed. These are usurers, usurers, witnesses, writers. In short, the consequences of both this world and the Hereafter are very bad. So we have to live from interest.<br> There are free opportunities of interest around us but we will forbid usury for our own fear out of fear of Allah. We will not accept interest and we will not pay interest to anyone and we will not witness it, Amen.\r\n', 'islam', 'Instructions', 251),
(15, 'islam_teach.jpg', 'What does Islam teach?', 'Islam means peace. Islam is the solution of humanity. There are five pillars of Islam which are Kalema, Namaz, Roza, Hajj, Zakat. Those who believe in each of these are true believers. Everything that happens to a child from birth to death must be guided by Islam. If he obeys the Qur\'an, his life will be happy. There will be no obstacles in his life. Islam teaches us not to sneer at anyone. Not to kill anyone unjustly without insulting anyone. <br> Islam teaches not to seize the property of others by force. If someone kills Muslims, Muslims will not kill them. This is what Islam teaches. <br> Throughout the ages, many prophets have been beaten, insulted, and humiliated in the propagation of Islam. But still, they did not refrain from the call to Islam. For guidance, Allah has sent many prophets and messengers from time to time to establish his religion.<br>\r\nThe last and greatest prophet of Islam, Hazrat Muhammad (peace be upon him) has suffered many blows at the hands of infidels for his call to Islam. The infidels surrounded his house to kill him, but he did not refrain from preaching Islam out of fear. He migrated from Medina to Mecca and then from Mecca to Medina, but he did not shy away from preaching Islam for fear of the infidels. Yes, this is what Islam teaches us.<br>\r\nWhen the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born, the situation in the Arab world was terrible. They lived in the age of ignorance. The people in that society were very bad. Peace returned to Arabia after the birth of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). And Allah sent the Prophet as a prophet to make the Arabs better and he slowly called all the people of the ignorant age of Arabia to Islam. <br> Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) fought many battles against the infidels. Wins. When many enemies came to fight him and became Muslims, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) forgave him without killing him and invited him to Islam. He accepted Islam. This is what Islam teaches us. In many countries of the world, Muslims are being harassed and persecuted step by step, yet Muslims do not take any action against them. Because Islam wants peace. <br> Islam does not want any chaos. Islam wants peace in the world.\r\n', 'There are seven pillars of Islam, each of which Muslims have to accept and pray five times a day. Hajj is to be done once in a lifetime. You have to fast or fast once a year during the month of Ramadan. Zakat is to be paid twice a year before Eid and among the poor and needy. That there should be no difference between the poor and the needy. If a poor man has not eaten, give him food, clothe the naked man, give food to the hungry man, stand by the helpless man in danger, be sympathetic to animals, respect women who are not engaged in obscene acts, keep yourself away from adultery.<br>\r\nThe followers of other religions are given guidance in their books. But within Islam the solution of the whole human race has been given. Which are not given in other texts. Other religions have been distorted from the beginning, but Islam is a religion and the Qur\'an is a book whose letters, words or words have not changed. Allah has given me an open challenge to find out the mistake somewhere in my Al-Quran.<br>\r\nTo this day, many people in the world have denied the verses of the Qur\'an, the words of the Qur\'an. Tried to change the Quran but they failed. Because Allah says you will not be able to deny my Qur\'an and I will maintain it. It is my responsibility to preserve the Qur\'an as I created it. People are treated using different verses of the Qur\'an. <br> Antidotes for many diseases are found. If we look at the current medical science, we will see that Islam and medical science are not far from Islam. Allah has given medicine in the Qur\'an for all diseases.

(16, 'music_islam3453445.jpg', 'Is music haram islam !!', 'Everyone is more or less involved in the debate over whether music is really forbidden. Muslims should all know what Islam says about music. Many of us may just know that in Islam, drinking alcohol, stealing humanity, not praying, misbehaving with adults, are the only things we think we will get. But in addition to these sins, there are many other Islamic prohibitions, including music, singing, writing music, promoting music, helping to promote music, everything will be considered a sin.<br>\r\nOur radio-TV phones and music players report music every day that the songs are at the top of the charts every week and we are forced to remember songs from start to finish or A-Z songs.<br> <br> As Muslims, we should actually do it. If you search the lyrics of these songs, you will easily understand that the mention of drug sexual violence or alcohol is much more in the true sense. Many songs may sound innocent, such as drums, tabla, harmonies, flutes, etc., all of which make up Islamic music, but it will be included in the haram.\r\nAll these things are forbidden in Islam. It is haraam for men and women to play musical instruments at weddings. So all kinds of instruments are forbidden for both men and women.<br>\r\nThere are also some hadiths about musical instruments. I have found the strongest hadith about the prohibition of music, there will be some people among my followers who will consider it permissible to have illicit sex, wear silk, drink alcohol and use musical instruments and there will be some people who will be by their side. On a hill and in the evening their shepherds would come to them with their appearance. If you ask them for anything, they will say: Go back to us tomorrow. GOD will destroy them, and cause mountains to fall on them, and the rest of them will fall ill, and they will be like that until the Day of Resurrection.<br>\r\nImam al-Ghazzali resumed the matter. He commented on the above hadith and wrote a long chapter on the subject of permissions and prohibitions. His writings were very reasonable.\r\n', 'There is a modern scholar who declared music halal. He is Yusuf al-Qaradawi. He also wrote long compositions about music. In which case they are haraam and permissible. The majority of scholars, such as Dr. Zakir Naik and Noman Ali Khan, have also said that music and musical instruments are completely forbidden in Islam. But when someone asks them why musical instruments are forbidden in Islam. Then they very naturally replied that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) had declared musical instruments to be forbidden in the music of Islam. That is why it is forbidden to us. Because as Muslims we should believe in the Qur\'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet.<br>\r\nWe cannot judge a whole thing by just a few facts. Not all songs are bad. Some songs are good. Many good music artists have contributed a lot to the society. There are many people who help people reach Allah through Islamic music. How could they do better if the music was really bad. So music can be good and bad at the same time. <br> Although music with musical instruments tends to be much more powerful. That is why it has been declared forbidden in Islam.\r\nThink for yourself before asking me if music is forbidden. Through some songs our Creator is called too short, too humble, our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is insulted, shirk is done with Allah, so we must stay away from music. After all, I know we all have weaknesses, mistakes and I also know that none of us are perfect.

It is important to remember that this scientific information was first revealed in the Qur\'an, which was revealed to an illiterate prophet about 1400 years ago.<br> In this way, Allah has pointed out to man many things in the material world, that is, science, which is one of the main features of the Qur\'an.<br>\r\nThey have been searching for their Creator since the day mankind was created. Man has at various times resorted to science and great religious books to find his Creator. The Qur\'an is the greatest religious book of Islam. we will learn about some of the information contained in the Qur\'an whose prophecies were written in this Holy Qur\'an fourteen years ago today. <br> Surprisingly, despite the existence of modern science, a prediction could not prove false. One of the first things to know is that the Qur\'an contains scientific information and historical information. <br> People now understand a lot of their truth. There is still a lot of information in the Qur\'an that people still do not have in mind and they are doing research on it. <br> There are many prophecies in the Qur\'an that have now been proven.\r\n1. Origin of life. The origin of life we all know has been from water. Another name for water is life. Almost every animal on earth needs water to survive. <br>\r\nEverything that exists on this earth is derived from life water and water was said to be the main material for the origin of life. The point is that the cells of the body of all the animals on earth are made of water. Due to which human life can exist. The body of human body and many other animals and the cytoplasm contains 80% water.\r\n', '2. Iron is not a natural thing. Iron originally came from outside the earth. This may be a little surprising information. But this is true. Hundreds of years ago, when the asteroid in space collided with the earth. As a result of the collision with the earth, a big explosion took place and iron spread all over the world. Due to which iron can be found everywhere in the world today. It has been said in the Holy Qur\'an that I have sent iron to the earth for the welfare of all mankind. Iron comes from outside the earth. Many of us know that the sky is protecting us from the harmful rays of the sun. The harmful rays of the sun coming from outside the earth are harmful to the human body. <br>\r\nIf there were no sky, human civilization would not survive on earth. Otherwise, the earth would have frozen long ago, because Allah has said in the Holy Qur\'an about the average temperature of the earth. I have made the sky a guard for you.

I will prove those things in the light of Hindu scriptures and Christian scriptures. Inshallah.\r\nThe main text of Christianity is the Bible. 22 Chapters three to five paragraphs. It is clearly stated that there is no image or deity of God.\r\nWe must first know what is meant by the traditional philosophy of God. First of all, there is no place for many gods in traditional religion. According to Hindu scriptures, God is one and unique. <br>Traditional philosophy says that God Himself is complete. That is, he was not born and he did not give birth to anyone. But he can take any form. Because he has the omnipotence of the universe.<br>\r\nIn the Rikveda it is said that God is one and only. That is, God is one and unique.\r\nIt has also been said that God cannot be explained by words, mind, eyes or any other senses.

In this surah it is said that,\r\nKulhu Allahu Ahad Allahu Samad means Allah is one and unique, Allah is self-sufficient. Lam Ya Alid Walam Yulad means he did not give birth to anyone and no one gave birth to him. <br> Walam ya qullahu kufuwan ahad means there is no one equal to him.<br>\r\nThe meaning of this surah of Quran Majid and some interpretations of Hindu religion above, it is understood that in Hinduism Allah and his chosen religion are mentioned. Wise people can easily understand the subject. Because Allah has made it clear in the Qur\'an that this Qur\'an is indeed a sign for the wise.\r\nIdolatry is undoubtedly a sin in Islam. And poetic virtue is only when one associates or equates another with Allah. On the Day of Judgment, God will forgive all the sins of the sinners, but Kabira will never forgive the sins of the sinners. Until that person repents to Allah for his sin. Idolatry is a heinous sin.<br>\r\nIn this context, the Qur\'an clearly states: \"Avoid unclean things, ie idols, and avoid lying.\" (Surah Hajj: 30).<br>\r\nIdols and sculptures are mentioned in the Qur\'an as misguided. Who is a greater tyrant than that man who wants to create a creation like mine? If they can afford it, let them make a grain-like me or a grain of barley. Hazrat Jabir bin Abdullah (Radiyallahu Ta\'ala Anhu) said that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) while in Makkah during the conquest of Makkah declared that it was forbidden to sell wine and idols and to sell pigs and dead animals.

Until then, no one will be able to access your file. <br> Sensitive Important Many more times we see the use of fingerprints in the field of security.\r\nIt is ensured that certain people can work in that place and no one else can access it. <br>\r\n The day before, maybe someone else could bring your personal belongings using your name. And if any crime was committed using it, you would be responsible for the crime and the police would arrest you. Thanks are to Allah the Almighty who created us with different and completely unique fingerprints for every human being. <br>\r\n Fingerprints with one do not match with another. Every human fingerprint in the world is completely different and completely different.\r\n Now biometrics are being used. So it is not possible for anyone else to use your fingerprints to endanger you with your information.\r\nIt\'s been a not very long time since we\'ve learned about fingerprints. <br> According to Wikipedia, Marcello Malpighi, an anatomy professor at the University of Bologna, discovered in 1880 that after holding something like metal glass, our fingerprints remained there. Then in the 1882 century, the German anatomist Johann Christoph Andreas Mayer realized that every human fingerprint is different.

In fact, I will be able to adjust it up to the tip of his finger. Yet man wants to deny what is before him. Subhan Allah.<br>\r\nUnbelievers doubt whether God will be able to rearrange human bones. And Allah answered It is not the bones but the tip of the human finger that is able to fill it completely. He is able to reconstruct with it up to the human fingerprint. <br>\r\n\r\n And the fingerprint we collect is from the tip of the finger. The fingerprint is the simplest and most accurate way to identify each person individually. Human identities are compiled in their fingers. The human identity is written with the help of code. The code is written on their fingers. The signal barcode system of the modern computer world is compared to a human fingerprint. <br> Human fingerprints are compared to bar codes. The fingerprint is a record of curvature that is caused by fusion between the dermis and the epidermis. The word fingertips refer to the fingers of all hands. On the Day of Resurrection, the people of the universe will be scattered everywhere and will reunite.\r\n  This is a manifestation of the omnipotence of Allah.

Allah the Almighty bestowed the infant son Ishmael in the house of Ibrahim (peace be upon him).<br>\r\nBy the command of Allah, the Prophet Ishmael (peace be upon him) was left in the desert of Arabia. Rachel, on the other hand, had children. The name of her unborn child is Isaac.<br>\r\nIsaac\'s son\'s name was Hazrat Yaqub (peace be upon him).\r\nThe number of sons of Hazrat Yaqub (as) was 12. The youngest son was named Yusuf Alai Sallam. Among the other sons were Yehuda, Labi, and Shaman. The Jewish nation later originated from yahuda, the son of the Prophet Jacob, and the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) came to this yahuda dynasty. Then came Hazrat Dawood Alai Sallam. The name of Dawood\'s son was Hazrat Sulaiman (as). Thus the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) came in stages.\r\nOf the 104 books of the great God, the big book is 4 books. These names are Torah, Psalms, Injil, Qur\'an. In the meantime, the Torah was revealed to Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). The Gospel was revealed to the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him). The Psalms were revealed to Hazrat Dawood (as) and the last and final divine book Quran Majeed was revealed to Hazrat Muhammad (as). The followers of Moses are called Jews.\r\n', 'But because of linguistic differences, we may think that all religions originated from different places. The essence of all these religions and all its religions is also different. But in reality, it is not like that at all. The essence of the three religions is the same. Tauhid means monotheism. Allah, the One and Only, has no partner. <br>\r\nAccording to Islam, the first man and the first prophet is Hazrat Adam Alai. According to Judaism and Christianity, Adam was the first man and the first prophet. But the pronunciation of the name is different. In Islam, the one who is called Adam is called Adom, the one who is called Judaism, and Christianity is called Adam. The Jewish Christians call Hazrat Noah (peace be upon him) Noah.<br>\r\nThey called Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) Abraham. They called the Prophet Ishmael (peace be upon him) Samuel. They called Prophet Isaac (peace be upon him) eyjeck. They called Hazrat Yaqub (as) Jacob.

They called Hazrat Zakariya (as) Zakariya. They called the Prophet David (peace be upon him) David. They told Hazrat Sulaiman (peace be upon him) to go to Solomon. They call Jesus the Prophet Jesus.<br>\r\nAlthough the prophets of the three religions are one, there are some differences in the original place. For example, the Jews consider Moses to be the greatest prophet. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Isa (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are not obeyed.<br>\r\nChristians consider Jesus to be the greatest prophet. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) does not care. But Islam has given equal status to all prophets.

Whoever is cursed by Allah will never be able to draw near to Allah. As a result, he attains worldly and otherworldly humiliation. To curse someone is to wish that he would be deprived of God\'s mercy. Which is not befitting for a believer. The beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) did not curse the infidels and polytheists who oppressed him.  <br> Narrated Abu Hurairah: He said: The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was told: O Messenger of Allah! You curse the polytheists. He said, \"I was not sent as a curse; Rather, I was sent as a mercy. <br> (Muslim, Hadith: 6506). But when a person drinks lime juice, he curses his beloved child, which is very sad. Because sometimes the curse of man really becomes effective. Narrated Abu Barja Al-Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him), he said that once a girl was riding on a camel. On top of that he also had some belongings of his tribe. Suddenly he saw the Prophet (peace be upon him). And their path was narrow because of the mountains. So the girl pulled the rope of the camel and said, ‘O Allah! Curse it. \'The narrator said,\' Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \'The camel that has been cursed should not be with us.\' (Muslim, Hadith: 6500) A believer can never do such a thing. Narrated Abdullah: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A believer can never be a slanderer, a slanderer, an immoral person, or a slanderer. (Tirmidhi, Hadith: 198) The word \'damn\' is often heard in people\'s quarrels.', 'If we look around, we can see that the society has increased. One is depriving the other of their rights. We are destroying the rights of one another. Another is embezzling money. People are being ignored. We are cursing each other for small mistakes. Who will consider halal as halal. Now you see brothers and sisters, sisters and friends, girlfriends and girlfriends are cursed if they make small mistakes. The father curses the child and the child curses the father. <br>\r\nThen wrath will descend on them from Allah Subhanahu wa Ta\'ala. Usually people do this kind of work out of anger. <br> Excessive cursing becomes a habit of some. But it is haraam to curse another. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Do not curse one another with the curse of Allaah, His wrath and Hell. (Tirmidhi, Hadith: 198) If people are cursed in this way, they are more likely to fall on themselves.<br>  Narrated Abu Darda: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When a servant curses an object, that curse moves towards the sky. Then the way to the sky of that curse is closed. Then he set out to return to the world, but he also tried to go left and right because the way to the world was blocked. Eventually, he finds no other way to return to the one who has been cursed. Then if the object is worthy of the curse, then the curse falls on it, otherwise, it falls on the curse. (Abu Dawood, Hadith: 4905) So if you are angry with someone, do not curse him; Rather, it is more beneficial to pray for his guidance. Every human being is a creature of Allah, so Allah the Almighty does not like to seek the destruction of his other creatures from the unjustly merciful Allah. May Allah protect us all from such acts.

(24, 'mohammad(sw)_meyeder_je_sikkhaditen.jpg', 'What Prophet Muhammad (sw) used to teach Daughter', '8 qualities are very important for women. It is the sole responsibility and duty of the family members to gradually inculcate or impart these qualities to them from infancy. <br> Because if they can raise the girl child from an early age according to the advice of the Prophet, they will become ideal women.<br> \r\nThe role of 8 qualities is very much to keep the self-esteem and superiority of women intact. The whole family will benefit from acquiring these qualities. From family to society. From society to the whole country and the world. It is also very easy for girls and women to get these tips for positional reasons.<br>\r\nThe birth of a baby girl is not an insult but honor and dignity. Bishwanabi has declared their superiority and honor. In establishing their rights and dignity, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) instructed them to do justice to women in his historic Farewell Hajj speech, saying, ‘Take the will for the welfare of women.’ <br>\r\n Encouraging Taqwa: Taqwa means fear of Allah. When a girl reaches the age of understanding, she should be trained in taqwa or fear of Allah. The whole family will benefit if taqwa or the quality of Allah is acquired in the heart of the girl child. The girl child will be safe due to taqwa. <br>\r\nOnly by fearing Allah can women protect themselves from all the slippage and temptations of life. The virtue of taqwa inspires women to lead a disciplined and ideal life. In the fear of Allah, he abstains from all kinds of sins, iniquities, injustices, and evil deeds. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) instructed women to attain taqwa. It has been narrated in the hadith-\r\n', 'Hazrat Ayesha (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to her, ‘O Ayesha! All you need is to fear Allah.  \'(Tirmidhi)<br>\r\n Abstinence from sins: The family takes care of all the children from birth. In the course of time, fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons are in most cases responsible for the upbringing of women. It is lawful for all women to be in the custody of their father, brother, husband, and son. Unless for some reason it is not forbidden by itself. <br>\r\nWomen eat halal food all the time from infancy to the end of life. And in it, just as women themselves are free from sin, so those who are nurtured by women also get sin-free life. That is why women are easier to liberate and succeed than men. Therefore, it is important to keep the girl child away from small evil habits and sinful deeds from an early age as well as to discourage sinful deeds. <br>\r\nWomen are most addicted to meaningless activities like gossip, jealousy, and violence, waste of time and money, TV, and serials. It is easy for a woman to lead a sinless life in adulthood if she can be kept away from this evil from an early age. <br>\r\nThat is why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave instructions and advice that small evil habits and sins are not given importance. The consequences of which are very terrible. It is important to make the girl child accustomed to avoiding minor sins from that age. \'<br>\r\n\r\nHazrat Anas Ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, \"Today you consider some deeds as lesser than hair (in a trivial sense), whereas in the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) we used to consider it a punishable crime.\" (Bukhari)<br>\r\n Getting used to prayers: Women are one of the tools to turn a house into a mosque. If the girl is accustomed to prayers by her mother, she will be able to turn her house into a prayer environment when she grows up. Can convert the house into a mosque. All that is needed is the willpower of women. <br> That is why Islam encourages women to perform prayers at home on time.

(25, 'sukur_haram542015458.jpg', 'Why eating pork is Forbidden in Islam', 'Today I will talk about why eating pork is forbidden in Islam. In the Qur\'an, it is haraam to eat pork.<br>  This is mentioned in at least four places. Surah Baqara Chapter 2 Verse 173, Surah Maeda Chapter 5 Verse 3, Surah An\'am Chapter 6 Verse 145, Surah Nahl Chapter 16 Verse 115. There it is mentioned that you are forbidden to eat pork, the flesh of dead animals, the flowing blood, and the food offered in the name of anyone other than Allah. Since dead animals are not offered in anyone\'s name, it is haraam to eat the flesh of dead animals. <br>\r\nAt least three places in the Bible say that eating pork is forbidden. the book of Leviticus chapter 11 paragraphs 7 to 8. It is said that you should not eat pork and do not touch its body because it is not lawful for you.  <br> Similarly, it has been said book of Deuteronomy Chapter 14 paragraph 8. It is said that the hooves of pigs are not divided so do not choose it because it is not halal for you. The same is said in the book of Isaiah chapter 65 paragraphs 2-5. So as a Christian, if you believe the Bible, then pork is forbidden for you.<br> \r\nThe verses of the Qur\'an alone are sufficient to give a satisfactory answer as to why it is forbidden. Exactly why the Qur\'an forbids the eating of pork is clearly stated in some verses. But it is true that what Allah has forbidden is for the good of His servants.\r\nIf you do not believe in the Qur\'an and the Bible then there are some scientific explanations. Pork is capable of giving birth to at least 70 diseases.\r\n', ' Different types of worms can be infected. Such as roundworms, tiny spiny worms, and crooked worms. The most terrifying and deadly of these is Tinea solium.<br>\r\nCommonly called ribbon worms. It grows in the abdomen and is much longer in shape. Its eggs enter the bloodstream and can penetrate almost all parts of the body. If it enters the brain, it can have a very difficult problem. Even death can occur. In addition, if it enters through the intestines, it can cause problems. Such as memory loss. Eye contact can cause blindness and can lead to heart failure. This means that it can destroy the function of any part of the body. Pork fat-producing ingredients are plentiful.<br>\r\nPork plays a very small role in building muscle. Eating pork can cause a variety of problems, such as hypertension or heart attack. About 50 percent of American hypertension patients are forbidden to eat pork. Many patients have been researched or observed that all the patients suffering from hypertension or various mental illnesses are mostly eating pork. Pigs have been called the dirtiest animals in the world. This creature feels comfortable living in its own excrement in human feces and other places. Allah created this creature for the sake of social creation or as a scavenger. Even 50-60 years ago, when sanitary latrines were not invented, there was a type of latrine in any city where meth would come from behind and fill the tank and throw it somewhere on the outskirts of the city.<br>\r\nYou may say that if it is forbidden then why did Allah create pigs? I don\'t think that\'s your sincere question. If there are sincere questions then I can ask you questions too. Why did God create such a painful, unholy thing? Rather, we can ask you why God created Satan. Does the Creator have no right to dictate to His servants whatever He wills? Do whatever you want. Who has the right to criticize his orders?\r\nMany may now argue that the developed world still has a clean pig farm. Where they are nurtured. They are also much dirtier on their much healthier farms. This pork is the food of the festival.  Pork is the favorite food of most people in Europe.  It is the only animal that invites other males to mate with its mate.<br>\r\n Friends, I hope you understand the reason why Muslims do not eat pork.\r\n', 'islam', 'Forbidden food', 316),

When I remembered my promise after three days, I went to that place and saw that Nabi Karim (sa) was still waiting for me. He looked at me and said, I have been waiting for you here for three days.

He was born in Mecca into a noble family in an exceedingly powerful tribe of peregrine herders and triple-crown merchants. His father died before he was born, and his mother died once he was solely six years previous. He was raised by Associate in Nursing adopted family into his adult life. Muhammad worked as a merchandiser for many years on the trade routes between peninsula, Syria, and Yemen. He met a affluent widow named Khadija World Health Organization employed him to guard her caravans on the trade routes and that they eventually married.\r\nWhen Muhammad was forty years previous he began hearing voices and seeing visions of divine angels. to higher perceive these visions he would move to Mount Hira and meditate. On one such journey in 610, the Archangel Gabriel looked as if it would him and told him that there was just one god, Allah, and he had chosen him as a prophet. Muhammad believed he was the last and greatest in an exceedingly series of prophets along side Ibrahim, Moses, and Jesus. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nMuhammad would still have these revelations and started preaching his message. He before long gained several followers but, his belief in mere one god careful the those that worshiped several gods.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt now the pagans in Mecca tried to travel to war with the Muslims in Medina. when many battles the Muslims defeated the pagans, and in 629 Muhammad came back to Mecca with 1500 converts and took management of the town.

He and his followers were persecuted and had to escape to the neighboring town of Medina in 622. There he and his followers were welcome and therefore the religion grew. when a lot of conflict they were able to come back to Mecca within the year 630 and it became the middle of Islam. when Muhammad’s death in 632, the teachings of Islam unfold apace to several individuals and places within the geographical area. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe period following Muhammad’s death is thought because the Rashidun Caliphate that lasted from 610-750. throughout this empire a Muslim administration and government was established and dominated the center East.

The initial 4 caliphs are referred to in Islaic history as the Rashidun Caliphate, meaning the \"Properly Guided Caliphs\". They were all firmly connected with Muhammed and were known for their initiative and Muslim devotion. During their rules, notwithstanding the difficulties and precariousness they needed to manage, the caliphate developed from being a simply Arabian power, into the biggest domain up to that point in world history covering an area from Egypt in the West to Persia in the East. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe first of the Rashidun Caliphate was Abu Bakr, and drove from 632-634. Abu Bakr was known as \"The Truthful\". He effectively halted uprisings in the area and solidly settled the Caliphate as the leader of the locale. The subsequent caliph was Umar ibn al-Khattab who managed from 634-644. He incredibly extended the Islamic Empire and effectively assumed command over the Middle East and adjoining locales like Egypt, Syria, and North Africa. The third caliph was Uthman from 644-656 who laid out a the authority heavenly book of Islam, the Quran. The last caliph was Ali ibn Abi Talib who managed from 656-661 and was known for his insight and talks. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nAli was killed in 661 and not long after The Umayyad Dynasty assumed command over the Islamic Empire. Under this tradition, the domain extended quickly to incorporate pieces of Northern Africa, Western India, and Spain. At its pinnacle, it was perhaps of the biggest domain since the beginning of time. The Umayyad brought together the realm through a few endeavors like making Arabic the authority language and laying out normal cash and arrangement of estimation. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nIn 750, The Abbasid Dynasty toppled the Umayyad Dynasty. The rule of the Abbasids marks a time of logical disclosure and accomplishment. This period is alluded to as the Islamic Golden Age. During this time numerous mechanical and creative accomplishments in science, math, medication, training, and workmanship were made. After this, the Abbasids moved to Egypt and restored the caliphate. Notwithstanding, starting now and into the foreseeable future the caliphate had minimal political power. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nMuslims believe that they\'re meant to share their wealth with those less lucky in their community of believers. every year Muslims square measure expected to offer a pair of.5% of their wages to charity.', 'islam', 'History', 211),
(71, 'Who-was-the-first-man.jpg', 'Who was the first man in world? and His History.', 'Reality about the start of all people could be a matter pricey to the hearts of the many.\r\nIndividuals from various different backgrounds, including different ethnic starting points and varying instructive foundations have endeavored clarifications, be that as it may, not a great reason can replace reality. In the Qur\'an Allah educated us regarding reality with respect to the beginning of the people, and His Prophet, Muhammad, cleared up this matter for his sidekicks, who made sense of it for their adherents, who clarified it for their supporters, etc, until reality contacted individuals today.Allah made the wide range of various sorts of manifestations before He made the mankind. Allah made the water, the air, the sky, the earth, the trees, the mountains, the valleys, the creatures and, surprisingly, the little bugs - before he made man. Allah made this large number of sorts of manifestations in six days. Every day resembled 1,000 (1,000) years. At the last piece of the 6th day, after the ^Asr time, Adam was made. It was Jumu^ah- - Friday.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this mud was the dirt of this world. Allah requested one of the holy messengers to assemble a small bunch of the multitude of various sorts of the world\'s dirts: the dark soil, the white soil, the red soil, and every one of the in the middle of between these varieties; including the delicate soil and the firm soil. This holy messenger took a small bunch from this large number of various types of soil and carried them to Paradise. This dirt was blended in with the water of Paradise and from this combination, the state of Adam was shaped. To this end you find among the posterity of Adam- - which incorporates all individuals - the white, the dark, the red, the yellow, the people who are simple, the people who are troublesome, and the people who in the middle between.\r\nich implies: Allah made Adam (the individual) from a mud that was poured and afterward dried taking the state of Adam.> <br><br>', 'Before Allah turned this mud to tissue, blood, and bones, and before Allah put Adam\'s spirit into his body, Satan (Iblis) came and analyzed this creation. Upon assessment, Iblis found this creation had inward cavities, and consequently he realize that this creation would have to take things inside its body. Iblis realized this creation wouldn\'t can go for significant stretches of time doing various issues without being needing a few things, similar to food, drink, rest, and such. Iblis realized this creation dislike the holy messengers, since heavenly messengers don\'t have interior body pits and need neither food nor drink nor rest. Allah gave them the solidarity to play out all what Allah requested them to perform- - without the requirement for eating, drinking, or resting to do as such. The holy messengers can bear things which the people can\'t bear. All this,Iblis knew. So Iblis, who was made from an unadulterated fire of fire (which creates no smoke); Iblis, a jinn, and the progenitor of all the jinn, who was a devotee at this timeframe and living in Paradise with the holy messengers venerating Allah- - conversed with that state of Adam. He told Adam, \"Allah created you for a matter that i am unable to see.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter the spirit of Adam joined his body, Allah gave to Adam the information on the names of everything. Allah gave Adam that information without an educator, i.e., without Adam gaining from somebody to obtain that information. Then Allah requested the heavenly messengers to prostrate to Adam keeping in mind this unique new creation (not out of love). Iblis was living with the holy messengers, so he, likewise, was requested to prostrate to Adam. The holy messengers prostrated to Adam since every one of the heavenly messengers are devoted; they don\'t resist Allah. Iblis, in any case, was haughty. He had a problem with Allah. Iblis said, \"I was made up of fireplace, and he was simply made up of soil, thus for what reason wouldn\'t it be advisable on behalf of me to prostrate to him? i\'ll not.\" By his proclamation Iblis silent that God wasn\'t merely in this frame of mind to prostrate to Adam. Subsequently, by having a problem with Allah and His request, Iblis reviled. This was the primary profanation Iblis committed.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAdam and Hawwa\' (Eve) lived respectively in Paradise for a while. Allah allowed them to eat from every one of the products of Paradise, with the exception of the products of one specific tree. Allah empowered them to move between different places in the obvious areas of Paradise to eat from the products of the soil benefit from these areas. Adam andHawwa\' (Eve) were not allowed to eat from that tree however Iblis murmured to them to eat from it. Then Hawwa\' (Eve) began empowering Adam to eat from that tree. At last the two of them ate from it. Doing so was corrupt, but it was a little sin and the two of them immediately atoned. What they said is referenced in Surat al-A^raf, Ayah 23: \"and that implies: Allah, we did bad form to ourselves.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBe careful with the people who guarantee matters in opposition to the reality of Islam. Adam was not the primary creation, and all individuals begin from him. Also, ProphetMuhammad plunged from Prophet Adam. Prophet Muhammad was not the principal creation, as certain individuals guarantee. Likewise, be careful with the individuals who guarantee the primary creation is the radiance of our Prophet. This is additionally invalid. There is no sahih hadith from the Prophet asserting such. There is, in any case, a manufactured hadith that the Prophet tended to Jabir by saying: \"The principal creation is the illumination of your Prophet, O Jabir.\" The hafidh, Ahmad al-Ghumariyy, referenced this hadith was manufactured in his book entitled, Al-Mughir ^Ala-l-Jami^ is-Saghir and the hafidh, as-Suyutiyy, said this hadith isn\'t affirmed. He referenced it in two (2) of his books: Al-Fatawa and The Explanation of at-Tirmidhiyy. What was affirmed from the Prophet was that the primary creation was the first water, which exists now under the ^Arsh.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBe careful with hypotheses which say people dropped from primates or that Adam was a crude stone age man. Adam was the main man and the principal human to get the Revelation of prophethood. He was the primary courier of Allah and he is the precursor of each and every individual from the mankind. He showed the main individuals how to live and how to accurately venerate Allah. He was a regarded and favored making of Allah. He was made from soil. In Surat al-Hajj Ayah 5, Allah said: \"and that implies: Adam was made from soil.> That is, would it be a good idea for one experience issues conceptualizing that an individual can be restored - taking into account this matter is improbable, a frail chance, or one that doesn\'t happen - then, at that point, recall that Allah made Adam from soil. Realize that the One Who made Adam from soil has the Power to revive a large number of you turn around into soil.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis is reality with regards to Prophet Adam.\"', 'islam', 'History', 196);

(72, 'Sufi-shaykhs-really-in-contact-with-Allaah.jpg', 'Are the Sufi shaykhs really in contact with Allaah?', 'The word Sufism was not known at the hour of the Messenger or the Sahaabah or the Taabieen. It emerged when a gathering of religious zealots who wore fleece (soof) arose, and this name was given to them. It was additionally said that the name was taken from the word soofiya (sophia) and that implies shrewdness in Greek. The word isn\'t gotten from al-safa (virtue) as some of them guarantee, on the grounds that the modifier got from safa is safaai, not soofi (sufi). The development of this new name and the gathering to whom it is applied exacerbated the divisions among Muslims. The early Sufis varied from the later Sufis who spread bidah (development) positively and made evade in both minor and significant structures ordinary among individuals, as well as the advancements against which the Messenger (harmony and endowments of Allaah arrive) cautioned us when he expressed, Beware of recently created things, for each recently designed thing is an advancement and each development is a wandering off. (Revealed by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is saheeh hasan). <br><br>\r\nComing up next is a correlation between the convictions and customs of Sufism and Islam which depends on the Quraan and Sunnah.\r\nSufism has various branches or tareeqahs, like the Teejaniyyah, Qaadiriyyah, Naqshbandiyyah, Shaadhiliyyah, Rifaaiyyah, and so on, the devotees of which all guarantee that their specific tareeqah is on the way of truth while the others are following misrepresentation. Islam restricts such sectarianism. Allaah expresses (understanding of the significance):<br><br>\r\nfurthermore, be not of al-mushrikoon (the doubters in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheists, barbarians, and so forth),\r\nOf the people who split up their religion (i.e., who left the genuine Islamic monotheism), and became factions, [i.e., they concocted new things in the religion (bidah) and followed their vain desires], every group cheering in that which is with it. [al-Room 30:31-32]<br><br>\r\nThe Sufis love others than Allaah, like Prophets and awliya [saints], living or dead. They say, Yaa Jeelaani, Yaa Rifaai [calling on their awliya], or O Messenger of Allaah, help and save or O Messenger of Allaah, our reliance is on you, and so forth.<br><br>\r\nHowever, Allaah denies us to approach anybody with the exception of Him in issues that are past the individual\'s abilities. In the event that an individual does this, Allaah will consider him a mushrik, as He expresses (understanding of the importance):<br><br>\r\nAlso, conjure not, other than Allaah, any that will neither benefit you, nor hurt you, however in the event that (in the event that) you did as such, you will unquestionably be one of the zaalimoon (polytheists and transgressors). [Yoonus 10:106]<br><br>\r\nThe Sufis accept that there are abdaal, aqtaab and awliya (sorts of holy people) to whom Allaah has provided the ability to run the undertakings of the universe. Allaah educates us regarding the mushrikeen (translation of the significance):<br><br>\r\nSay [O Muhammad]: And who arranges the issues? They will say. Allaah. [Yoonus 10:31]<br><br> The mushrik Arabs find out about Allaah than these Sufis!\r\nThe Sufis go to other than Allaah when disaster strikes, however Allaah expresses (translation of the importance):\r\nWhat\'s more, assuming that Allaah contacts you with hurt, none can eliminate it except for He, and on the off chance that He contacts you with great, He can do all things. [al-Anaam 6:17]<br><br>A few Sufis put stock in wahdat al-wujood (solidarity of presence). They don\'t have the possibility of a Creator and His creation, rather they say that everything is creation and everything is god. The Sufis advocate outrageous austerity in this life and don\'t trust in taking the vital means or in jihaad, however Allaah expresses (translation of the significance):<br><br>', 'However, look for with that (abundance) which Allaah has presented to you, the home of the Hereafter, and fail to remember not your piece of lawful delight in this world [al-Qasas 28:77]<br><br>\r\nFurthermore, prepare against them generally that you container of force [al-Anfaal 8:60]<br><br> The Sufis allude the possibility of ihsaan to their shaykhs and advise their supporters to have an image of their shaykh as a top priority when they recall Allaah and in any event, when they are imploring. Some of them even put an image of their shaykh before them when they are supplicating. The Prophet (harmony and gifts of Allaah arrive) said: Ihsaan is the point at which you love Allaah as though you can see Him, and despite the fact that you can\'t see Him, He can see you. (Revealed by Muslim).<br><br> The Sufis permit moving, drums and instruments, and raising the voice while making dhikr, however Allaah expresses (translation of the importance):\r\nThe devotees are just the people who, when Allaah is referenced, feel a trepidation in their souls [al-Anfaal 8:2]<br><br>The Sufis present love sonnets referencing the names of ladies and young men in their dhikr get-togethers, and they rehash words like love, energy, want, etc, as though they are in a social event where individuals dance and drink wine and applaud and yell. All of this has to do with the traditions and demonstrations of love of the mushrikeen. Allaah expresses (understanding of the significance):\r\nTheir salaah (petition) at the House (of Allaah, i.e., the Kabah at Makkah) was only whistling and applauding [al-Anfaal 8:35]<br><br>\r\nA few Sufis puncture themselves with bars of iron, saying, O my granddad! So the shayaateen come to them and help them, since they are looking for the assistance of somebody other than Allaah . Allaah expresses (understanding of the importance):\r\nFurthermore, whosoever dismisses (blinds himself) from the recognition of the Most Beneficent (Allaah), We name for him a shaytaan (demon) to be a qareen (cozy ally) for him. [al-Zukhruf 43:36]<br><br>\r\nThe Sufis guarantee to have gnosis and information on the concealed, yet the Quraan demonstrates them to be liars. Allaah expresses (translation of the importance):\r\nExpress: None in the sky and the earth knows the ghayb (concealed) with the exception of Allaah [al-Naml 27:65]<br><br>\r\nThe Sufis guarantee that Allaah made the world for Muhammad (harmony and gifts of Allaah arrive), however the Quraan demonstrates them to be liars. Allaah expresses (translation of the significance):Also, I (Allaah) made not the jinns and people aside from they ought to love Me (Alone). [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]<br><br>\r\n\r\nAllaah, may He be celebrated and commended, tended to His Prophet (harmony and endowments of Allaah arrive) with the words (understanding of the importance):\r\nAlso, love your Lord until there comes unto the assurance (i.e., demise). [al-Hijr 15:99]<br><br> The Sufis guarantee that they can see Allaah in this life, yet the Quraan demonstrates them to be liars. Allaah expresses (translation of the importance):\r\n\r\n[Moosa said:] O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I might view You. Allaah said, You can\'t see Me [al-Araaf 7:143]<br><br> The Sufis guarantee that they take information straightforwardly from Allaah, without the intervention of the Prophet (harmony and favors of Allaah arrive) and in a cognizant state (rather than dreams). So would they say they are superior to the Sahaabah??\r\nThe Sufis guarantee that they take information straightforwardly from Allaah, without the intercession of the Prophet (harmony and endowments of Allaah arrive). They say, Haddathani qalbi a Rabbi (My heart told me from my Lord).<br><br> The Sufis observe Mawlid and hold social affairs for sending endowments on the Prophet (harmony and gifts of Allaah arrive), however they conflict with his lessons by bringing their voices up in dhikr and anaasheed (strict tunes) and qaseedahs (sonnets) that contain obtrusive avoid. Did the Prophet (harmony and favors of Allaah arrive) praise his birthday? Did Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, the four imaams or any other person praise his birthday? Who knows more and is more right in love, the Prophet (harmony and favors of Allaah arrive) and the Salaf, or the Sufis?<br><br>\r\nThe Sufis are indiscriminately faithful to their shaykhs, in any event, when what they conflict with the expressions of Allaah and His Messenger. However, Allaah, may He be commended, expresses (understanding of the importance):\r\nO you who accept! Try not to put (yourselves) forward before Allaah and His Messenger [al-Hujuraat 49:1]<br><br>\r\nThe Sufis use charms, letters and numbers for simply deciding and for making special necklaces and charms, etc.\r\nThe Sufis don\'t limit themselves to the particular gifts on the Prophet (harmony and favors of Allaah arrive) that were described from him. They created new recipes that include looking for his endowments and different sorts of obtrusive avoid which are unsuitable to the one on whom they are sending favors.\r\nConcerning the topic of the whether the Sufi shaykhs have some sort of contact, this is valid, yet their contact is with the shayaateen, not with Allaah, so they rouse each other with decorated discourse as a daydream (or via misdirection), as Allaah expresses (understanding of the importance): Thus We have designated for each Prophet foes shayaateen (fiends) among humanity and jinns, rousing each other with enhanced discourse as a dream (or via trickery). Assuming that your Lord had so willed, they could never have done it [al-Anaam 6:112]<br><br>\r\nWhat\'s more, Allaah expresses (translation of the importance):\r\nWhat\'s more, absolutely, the shayaateen (fallen angels) do move their companions (from humankind) [al-Anaam 6:121]<br><br> Will I illuminate you (O individuals!) upon whom the shayaateen (fiends) slip?\r\nThey slip on each lying, wicked individual. [al-Shuara 221-222]<br><br>This is the contact that is genuine, not the contact that they dishonestly guarantee to have with Allaah. Commended be Allaah far over that.\r\n\r\n(See Mujam al-Bida, 346 359). At the point when a portion of these Sufi shaykhs vanish unexpectedly from seeing their supporters, this is the consequence of their contact with the shayaateen, who might try and convey them to a far off place and get them back that very day or night, to delude their human devotees.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo the significant rule here isn\'t to pass judgment on individuals by the exceptional accomplishments that they might do. We ought to pass judgment on them by how intently or in any case they stick to the Quraan and Sunnah. The genuine companions of Allaah (awliya) are not really known for performing bewildering accomplishments. In actuality, they are the ones who love Allaah in the way that He has endorsed, and not by doing demonstrations of bidah. The genuine awliya or companions of Allaah are those whom our Lord has portrayed in the hadeeth qudsi described by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (5/2384) from Abu Hurayrah, who said:<br><br> \"The Messenger of Allaah (harmony and gifts of Allaah arrive) said: Allaah said, Whoever shows ill will towards a companion (wali) of Mine, I pronounce battle against him. My slave doesn\'t gravitate toward to Me with much else cherished by Me than the strict obligations that I have urged on him, and My slave keeps on gravitating toward to Me with supererogatory (naafil) acts, so I will adore him. At the point when I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he hits and his foot with which he strolls. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would doubtlessly give it to him, and were he to ask Me for asylum, I would unquestionably concede him it.\" <br><br> What\'s more, Allaah is the Source of Strength and the Guide to the Straight Path.\r\n', 'islam', 'Islam', 234);
